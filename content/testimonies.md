> "He is ready to help anytime. He was very patient and explained very clearly. Helped me to understand the material. Answered to all my questions. Very professional!!!" **~CS1555 student**

> "Took the time to show us actual SQL code and run it to show what it does. He was always such a pleasant person to be around and would do all that he could to help. If he taught any classes, I would take them with him, because he explains things very clearly. He is likely the reason why I understood what I did in the class." **~CS1555 student**

> "Very knowledgable about the course topics and recitation materials, extremely good at explaining them to students. The passion he displays for teaching, as a recitation instruction, the quality and engagement of the recitation, is something I rarely encountered in my entire college career. He is an ideal instructor that has great influence on any one of his students." **~CS1555 student**
